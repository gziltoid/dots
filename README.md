# Connecting Dots and Lines Visualization

Implemented a simple visualization using the package [graphics.py](https://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/) by John Zelle.  

To run the animation just run a Python script:  
`$ ./dots.py`  

To save the animation as a GIF file run the script with an option *--gif*:  
`$ ./dots.py --gif`
